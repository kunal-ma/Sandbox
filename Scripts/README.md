## Getting Started

> [!WARNING]
> These scripts are primarily designed for **Windows 10** and may not function as expected on other Windows versions or configurations. It is recommended to **review and adjust** the scripts as necessary before execution.

- **AutoHotkey**: These scripts require **AutoHotkey v2** to be installed on the system. The scripts can be executed by double-clicking the `.ahk` files.

- **Python**: These scripts require **Python 3.6 or higher** to be installed on the system, along with the necessary dependencies specified in the script comments.

    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```

- **Batch & PowerShell**: These scripts run **natively** without the need for extra installations, but may depend on additional tools available in the system PATH. Any required tools will be specified in the script comments.

    ```powershell
    # Batch script
    .\script_name.bat
    # Powershell script
    .\script_name.ps1
    ```
